        <br><br><div class="h2" style="  word-wrap: break-word">Solution in field of usability</div><br>
        <div style="align-self: stretch"> 
<div class="tx" style=" word-wrap: break-word">The way we present information in an application is crucial for usability and overall user experience. While certain
functions are necessary, their placement and accessibility within the user interface need careful consideration to
maintain a smooth flow. <br><br>In this case, the physical measurement function is the most accurate and essential part of the application. However, its
prominent display disrupts the application's information structure, making the interface feel cluttered or overwhelming.
To resolve this issue, the function has been moved to the

  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Hamburger menu, </span>
a location that allows users to access it without interfering with the main flow of the application.
<br><br>
Additionally, the Hamburger menu now includes a list of saved data from previous measurements, ensuring that users can
easily retrieve past information without cluttering the main interface. This not only preserves the application's
streamlined design but also enhances its practicality.<br><br> By relocating the physical measurement function and associated data to the Hamburger menu, the application's usability
is improved, keeping the main interface clean and ensuring that essential functions remain easily accessible when
needed.
<br><br><br><br>
  
  <div><img class="img1" style="align-self: center;" src="/ringsizer/paper.png" /><br><br><br>


Enhancing the accuracy of measurements is a key aspect of improving user experience and ensuring the system effectively
meets real-world needs. In line with usability principles, design changes can make a significant difference in how users
interact with the system.
<br><br> To improve the
<span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">accuracy of
    the measurements, </span>
  I introduced a visual enhancement where the area inside the circle of the ring is now filled with a distinct color. This
  allows users to take measurements more effectively, regardless of the ring's thickness, ensuring that the tool adapts to
  various scenarios. Additionally, the ring has been 
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">equipped with a center mark,</span>
  guiding the user to place it precisely on the measurement target. <br><br> This design change follows
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Usability Heuristic #2 - Match Between the System and the Real World,</span>
  ensuring that the system aligns with how users expect it to function in practical, real-world conditions.

 
  <br><br><br> <div><img class="img1" src="/ringsizer/field.png" /><br><br><br>
  
         
        User interface design plays a crucial role in ensuring users have a smooth, intuitive experience. Streamlining the
        user path can prevent frustration, build trust, and give users more control over their interactions with the system.
        <br><br>I revised the
            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">UI, </span>
          modifying the user flow by moving the
           <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">“Measurement Results”
            </span>
          to appear directly on the same screen. This change eliminates the need for users to navigate to a separate page, where
          they were previously required to watch 30-second paid ads before seeing their results. By delivering the expected
          outcome immediately, the update enhances the user experience.

            <br><br>  This adjustment aligns with
                    <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Usability Heuristic #3 – User Control and Freedom,</span>
                  ensuring that users feel in control of the product without being forced into unnecessary delays or distractions. It also
                  helps build trust by removing frustrating roadblocks and providing a more seamless interaction.
  <br><br>
  By relocating the measurement results to the same screen and removing disruptive ads, the product now offers a more
  user-friendly and transparent experience. This gives users greater freedom and control, fostering a stronger sense of
  trust and satisfaction with the application.
            <br><br>

          <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Accessibility</span> is a crucial aspect of design, ensuring that applications are usable by everyone, including those with
visual impairments or cognitive differences. Following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards is
essential for creating an inclusive digital experience.
<br><br> To achieve the highest level of
                <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">WCAG compliance,</span>
            it's important to aim for a text contrast ratio of 
                            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">7:1,</span>
                             which ensures readability for users with visual impairments. In
            the original app, the current contrast level is significantly higher at 
              <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">21:1,</span> 
              which can actually create issues for
            certain users, such as those with astigmatism or autism, who may find it overwhelming or difficult to process.
            <br><br>
      
                Reducing the contrast ratio to the recommended level not only improves WCAG compliance but also makes the application
                more user-friendly for individuals with specific needs. This adjustment supports accessibility goals and contributes to
                a better, more equitable digital experience for all users.

                Right solution is to reduce it and to make lives of people with Astigmatism or Autismus easier.

           Color choice plays a powerful role in design, as it influences users' subconscious perceptions and emotions. Selecting
          the right color palette is crucial for aligning with the desired brand message and user experience. </span>
  <br><br>
          Initially, I didn’t have a strong argument to change the blue color in the design. Blue is subconsciously associated
          with trust, precision, and purity, which aligns perfectly with the product’s goals, making it an ideal choice for
          conveying reliability and accuracy.
  <br><br>
          To enhance the overall design, I created a
            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">moodboard</span>
          that captures the feeling of a physical measurement tool and a jeweler's workspace, incorporating a retro, pixelized
          shadow effect. This visual concept was then tested through a
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">survey</span> to ensure it resonated with users and aligned with the intended goals.
              <br><br>
              By retaining the blue color, which fosters trust and precision, and reinforcing the design with a moodboard inspired by
              real-world tools, I was able to create a cohesive and emotionally resonant visual experience. The survey results
              confirmed that the design met its objectives, blending functionality with an aesthetic that users positively associate
              with accuracy and craftsmanship.

A well-structured <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Design System.</span>
is key to maintaining consistency and coherence across all aspects of an application,
ensuring a seamless user experience. </span>
  <br><br>
on the image below, you can see the fully developed Design System. It includes a comprehensive set of visual guidelines,
components, and interaction patterns that provide clarity and uniformity throughout the interface. This system serves as
a foundation for scalable, cohesive design, ensuring that all elements work together harmoniously.
  <br><br>
  By establishing a consistent Design System, we ensure that the application not only looks polished but also functions
  intuitively across different use cases, reinforcing both usability and brand identity.

            Logos are a central element of brand identity, and simplifying their design can make them more effective and visually
            appealing. Consistency in color and design is crucial for maintaining a clean and recognizable brand presence.
            <br><br>
            I updated the logo by aligning it with the same color system used throughout the design, ensuring consistency across the
            brand. Additionally, I removed any unnecessary and overwhelming design elements, creating a more streamlined and modern
            look that better reflects the brand’s values.
  <br><br>
            By simplifying the logo and maintaining a cohesive color scheme, the design now feels more balanced and professional.
            This update strengthens the brand’s visual identity, making it more memorable and easier to recognize.
