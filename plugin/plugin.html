          Understanding user behavior is essential for creating a product that meets their needs and expectations. Insights from
        user research can provide valuable context for design decisions and help address user motivations.
  <br><br>
    To better understand, let‚Äôs examine the user research insights: 
  <span class=" bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">64% of customers</span>
   are actually
        looking for a
          <span class=" bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">gift.</span> 
           This finding sheds light on user intent, revealing that a significant portion of the audience is
        seeking a product not for personal use, but for gifting purposes.

          <img class="img1" src="/ringsizer/data.png"> <br><br>
          <span class=" bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">72% of customers</span> 
           hesitate to buy a ring due to fear of choosing the wrong size,
          leading them to opt for other goods instead. This highlights a major concern that affects their purchasing decisions.
          However, 
          <span class=" bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">24% of users</span>
           are specifically searching for an engagement ring for their partner, showing a clear segment of
          customers with a strong intent but likely facing the same sizing hesitation.
<br><br>
          These insights suggest the need to focus on providing solutions that help users confidently select the right ring size,
          especially for those purchasing engagement rings. Addressing this fear of error could significantly reduce friction in
          the purchasing process, improving conversions and user satisfaction.

  User testing is a valuable tool for identifying challenges users face while interacting with a product. Through
  moderated user testing, we can uncover areas that need improvement to enhance the overall user experience.
  <br><br>
  During moderated user testing, I discovered that 
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">75% of users</span>
  are struggling to find the correct <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">position for the ring on the screen.</span>
   This difficulty highlights a significant issue in the interface, where users are unsure how to accurately
  position the ring for measurement or selection, creating friction in the user journey.
  <br><br>
  In the same moderated user testing, it was found that 
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">100% of users</span> 
  feel overwhelmed by the amount of 
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">advertising</span>
  within the application. This saturation of ads detracts from their overall experience, making it challenging for users
  to focus on the core functionalities of the product.

  This overwhelming feeling highlights the need to reevaluate the advertising strategy within the application. Reducing
  the volume and frequency of ads, or strategically placing them in less intrusive ways, could significantly improve user
  engagement and satisfaction, allowing users to navigate the application more comfortably.</div>

User experience is deeply intertwined with emotional responses, and understanding these emotions is critical for
refining the design of an application. By analyzing user journeys, we can uncover how specific interactions shape users'
feelings throughout their experience. 
<br><br>
After conducting interviews with an expert and testing the RingSizer App with real users, I developed the original app's
User Journey to illustrate how various aspects of the app affect users' emotions.

        <div style="align-self: stretch"> 
<div class="tx" style=" word-wrap: break-word">The way we present information in an application is crucial for usability and overall user experience. While certain
functions are necessary, their placement and accessibility within the user interface need careful consideration to
maintain a smooth flow. <br><br>In this case, the physical measurement function is the most accurate and essential part of the application. However, its
prominent display disrupts the application's information structure, making the interface feel cluttered or overwhelming.
To resolve this issue, the function has been moved to the

  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Hamburger menu, </span>
a location that allows users to access it without interfering with the main flow of the application.
<br><br>
Additionally, the Hamburger menu now includes a list of saved data from previous measurements, ensuring that users can
easily retrieve past information without cluttering the main interface. This not only preserves the application's
streamlined design but also enhances its practicality.<br><br> By relocating the physical measurement function and associated data to the Hamburger menu, the application's usability
is improved, keeping the main interface clean and ensuring that essential functions remain easily accessible when
needed.
<br><br><br><br>
  
  <div><img class="img1" style="align-self: center;" src="/ringsizer/paper.png" /><br><br><br>


Enhancing the accuracy of measurements is a key aspect of improving user experience and ensuring the system effectively
meets real-world needs. In line with usability principles, design changes can make a significant difference in how users
interact with the system.
<br><br> To improve the
<span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">accuracy of
    the measurements, </span>
  I introduced a visual enhancement where the area inside the circle of the ring is now filled with a distinct color. This
  allows users to take measurements more effectively, regardless of the ring's thickness, ensuring that the tool adapts to
  various scenarios. Additionally, the ring has been 
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">equipped with a center mark,</span>
  guiding the user to place it precisely on the measurement target. <br><br> This design change follows
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Usability Heuristic #2 - Match Between the System and the Real World,</span>
  ensuring that the system aligns with how users expect it to function in practical, real-world conditions.

 
  <br><br><br> <div><img class="img1" src="/ringsizer/field.png" /><br><br><br>
  
         
        User interface design plays a crucial role in ensuring users have a smooth, intuitive experience. Streamlining the
        user path can prevent frustration, build trust, and give users more control over their interactions with the system.
        <br><br>I revised the
            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">UI, </span>
          modifying the user flow by moving the
           <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">‚ÄúMeasurement Results‚Äù
            </span>
          to appear directly on the same screen. This change eliminates the need for users to navigate to a separate page, where
          they were previously required to watch 30-second paid ads before seeing their results. By delivering the expected
          outcome immediately, the update enhances the user experience.

            <br><br>  This adjustment aligns with
                    <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Usability Heuristic #3 ‚Äì User Control and Freedom,</span>
                  ensuring that users feel in control of the product without being forced into unnecessary delays or distractions. It also
                  helps build trust by removing frustrating roadblocks and providing a more seamless interaction.
  <br><br>
  By relocating the measurement results to the same screen and removing disruptive ads, the product now offers a more
  user-friendly and transparent experience. This gives users greater freedom and control, fostering a stronger sense of
  trust and satisfaction with the application.

          <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Accessibility</span> is a crucial aspect of design, ensuring that applications are usable by everyone, including those with
visual impairments or cognitive differences. Following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards is
essential for creating an inclusive digital experience.
<br><br> To achieve the highest level of
                <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">WCAG compliance,</span>
            it's important to aim for a text contrast ratio of 
                            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">7:1,</span>
                             which ensures readability for users with visual impairments. In
            the original app, the current contrast level is significantly higher at 
              <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">21:1,</span> 
              which can actually create issues for
            certain users, such as those with astigmatism or autism, who may find it overwhelming or difficult to process.
            <br><br>
      
                Reducing the contrast ratio to the recommended level not only improves WCAG compliance but also makes the application
                more user-friendly for individuals with specific needs. This adjustment supports accessibility goals and contributes to
                a better, more equitable digital experience for all users.

                Right solution is to reduce it and to make lives of people with Astigmatism or Autismus easier.

           Color choice plays a powerful role in design, as it influences users' subconscious perceptions and emotions. Selecting
          the right color palette is crucial for aligning with the desired brand message and user experience. </span>
  <br><br>
          Initially, I didn‚Äôt have a strong argument to change the blue color in the design. Blue is subconsciously associated
          with trust, precision, and purity, which aligns perfectly with the product‚Äôs goals, making it an ideal choice for
          conveying reliability and accuracy.
  <br><br>
          To enhance the overall design, I created a
            <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">moodboard</span>
          that captures the feeling of a physical measurement tool and a jeweler's workspace, incorporating a retro, pixelized
          shadow effect. This visual concept was then tested through a
  <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">survey</span> to ensure it resonated with users and aligned with the intended goals.
              <br><br>
              By retaining the blue color, which fosters trust and precision, and reinforcing the design with a moodboard inspired by
              real-world tools, I was able to create a cohesive and emotionally resonant visual experience. The survey results
              confirmed that the design met its objectives, blending functionality with an aesthetic that users positively associate
              with accuracy and craftsmanship.

         Logos are a central element of brand identity, and simplifying their design can make them more effective and visually
            appealing. Consistency in color and design is crucial for maintaining a clean and recognizable brand presence.
            <br><br>
            I updated the <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">logo</span> 
            by aligning it with the same color system used throughout the design, ensuring consistency across the
            brand. Additionally, I removed any unnecessary and overwhelming design elements, creating a more streamlined and modern
            look.
  <br><br>
            By simplifying the
