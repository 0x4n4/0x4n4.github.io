    <div style="align-self: stretch" > <br>

  <div class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">When I was a child, I was firmly convinced that by 2020 it would be easy to buy a tourist ticket to Mars. But it didn’t happen. We, as humanity, got stuck in a bunch of problems separating us from a bright future, such as war, poverty, inequality, this list you may continue by yourself...

<div class="pad">
  <div class="h2" style="word-wrap: break-word">Research and problem statement</div>
  <div style="align-self: stretch" > <br>
 
    <div class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">The people we surveyed were truly diverse; they had different lifestyles, priorities, and skills, but they were united by one thing: all of them were worried about the social issue. During 
      <span class="bo"style=" word-wrap: break-word">user interviews, </span>  
      we also learned that most people feel disappointment and a sense of powerlessness due to the lack of ability to influence the situation. This sometimes leads to feelings of guilt, which may be familiar to my reader as well.
At the same time, there are initiatives and organizations on the other side that need support but lack mass expression and simply "free hands". The 
      <span class="bo"style=" word-wrap: break-word">mission </span>   
      of this Product is to connect them. We formulated the
    <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word"> problem statement </span>
as: 
   <br><br> <span class="bo" style=" word-wrap: break-word">"An interested, but inactive person, needs a way to confidently join social initiatives, because they want to contribute, but feel like they don’t have an impact".
      <br/>
      <br/>
    </span>
      <span class="" style=" word-wrap: break-word">So here’s the thing. The biggest path always consists of small steps. And we’ve designed a product that allows everyone who wishes to take these steps in the most comfortable way possible to avoid frustrating patterns. The 
        <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word"> concept</span> 
        that will connect the need with the resource. Making this world better. To connect the skills and free time with a project/initiative/organization in need of this type of support.

    <div class="tx" style=" word-wrap: break-word">Specifically: the user can choose the most interesting areas of problem, then choose from the proposed list the type of desired activity and the resources and skills available. Location. And based on these parameters, in a gamified form, they will be offered to choose an activity for themselves at a preferred time. By swiping through the cards, we get information including about projects in which we may not participate, which nevertheless greatly affects our awareness of processes and activities in the selected directions in our location.
      <br/>During the card review process, we can also go back to the ones we initially rejected and add events of interest to our selected list before making a final decision on participation and committing.
      <br/>Additionally, there is also an option to view information with records on past events and activities of other groups and users, which may inspire us to participate in them next time and also visually see the result of influence and actions.

  <div class="h2" style="word-wrap: break-word">Prototyping<br></div>
  <br> 
  
  <div class="tx" style="  word-wrap: break-word"> But this time to developing the inteface I played around with an AI tool called Uizard, wich lets to create a user interfaces just giving a promp, or a hand-drawn low-fi prototipe, as I did. 
    It was quite important to me to understand how deep we alredy going into this derection and for how long we will still need a Human Designer as it is. So I learned that the tool allows to save a lot of time and get a really nice structure. 
    I just worked a bit, adding black and white graphic charactes, wich are turned back to back (screen 1) untill we connect them with a skills (screen 2) and then they are collaborating and liturally turning one to another (screen 3).
    So yes, we still defentetly need a Human to give at least right promt. AI is great, but for now it is not possible to provide some desigions in a Metal Model field, for example. 
  And if that time comes, when the machines will understand human perception drivers better than good Designer does, just hit me up.
