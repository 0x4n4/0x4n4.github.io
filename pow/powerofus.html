  <div class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">When I was a child, I was firmly convinced that by 2020 it would be easy to buy a tourist ticket to Mars. But it didn’t happen. We, as humanity, got stuck in a bunch of problems separating us from a bright future, such as war, poverty, inequality, this list you may continue by yourself...

      <span class="bo tx"style=" word-wrap: break-word">user interviews, </span>  
      <span class=" tx"style=" word-wrap: break-word">we also learned that most people feel disappointment and a sense of powerlessness due to the lack of ability to influence the situation. This sometimes leads to feelings of guilt, which may be familiar to my reader as well. At the same time, there are initiatives and organizations on the other side that need support but lack mass expression and simply "free hands". The </span>

      <span class="bo tx"style=" word-wrap: break-word">mission </span>   
      <span class="tx"style=" word-wrap: break-word">of the Product is to connect them. We formulated the

      </div>
    </span>
      <span class="tx" style=" word-wrap: break-word">So here’s the thing. The biggest path always consists of small steps. And we’ve designed a product that allows everyone who wishes to take these steps in the most comfortable way possible to avoid frustrating patterns. The
