    <div style="align-self: stretch" > <br>

  <div class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">When I was a child, I was firmly convinced that by 2020 it would be easy to buy a tourist ticket to Mars. But it didn’t happen.</p>
    <br>We, as humanity, got stuck in a bunch of problems separating us from a bright future, such as war, poverty, inequality, this list you may continue by yourself.</p>

<div class="pad">
  <div class="h2" style="word-wrap: break-word">Research and problem statement:</div>
  <div style="align-self: stretch" > <br>
 
    <div class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">The people we surveyed were truly diverse; they had different lifestyles, priorities, and skills, but they were united by one thing: all of them were worried about the social issue. During user interviews, we also learned that most people feel disappointment and a sense of powerlessness due to the lack of ability to influence the situation. This sometimes leads to feelings of guilt, which may be familiar to my reader as well.
      <br>At the same time, there are initiatives and organizations on the other side that need support but lack mass expression and simply `free hands`.</p>
     
    <br><span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">We formulated the problem statement as: </span>
    
    <span style=" word-wrap: break-word">"An interested, but inactive person, needs a way to confidently join social initiatives, because they want to contribute, but feel like they don’t have an impact".
      <br/>
      <br/>
    </span>
      <span class="" style=" word-wrap: break-word">So here’s the thing. The biggest path always consists of small steps. And we’ve designed a product that allows everyone who wishes to take these steps in the most comfortable way possible to avoid frustrating patterns. A concept that will connect the need with the resource. Making this world better. To connect the skills and free time with a project/initiative/organization in need of this type of support.
