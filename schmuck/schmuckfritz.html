        <span class="tx" style="word-wrap: break-word">Interest in art and culture lies beyond basic needs. During the
          Renaissance, art became accessible not only to the church, but also to the elite. In an era of democracy, it
          belongs to all of us. Since ancient times, jewelry has been a tool for conveying religious contexts and status
          attributes. Which carries a strong emotional charge.

      <div class="tx" style="align-self: stretch; text-align: justify"><br>
In the competitive landscape of jewelry galleries in Berlin, standing out requires a strategic approach to engaging
customers and showcasing unique offerings. Leveraging insights from competitors can help refine our approach and enhance
customer experience. <br><br>
        <li> No other jewelry gallery in Berlin possesses such an extensive 
          <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">collection,</span> 
          which provides us with a significant
        advantage in attracting a diverse clientele. Our vast assortment not only highlights our commitment to quality and
        craftsmanship but also sets us apart in a crowded marketplace. By emphasizing the uniqueness of our offerings, we can
        draw in both locals and visitors looking for exceptional pieces that they won't find elsewhere.
    
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Each one place has its own fiche, e.g. seasonal events, or events attached to the famous conferentions, to reach an
        attention of those people, who come to Berlin directly to visit it.
          <br><br>
        <li>We can learn from our competitors, who consistently provide <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">newsletter</span>
           to keep their customer base informed and
        engaged. By regularly updating their audience online, they ensure that their customers are aware of new arrivals,
        special promotions, and upcoming events. This proactive communication not only enhances customer engagement but also
        fosters a sense of community around their brand.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>Also <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">online shops</span>
           that feature clear pricing, detailed item descriptions, and user-friendly shopping carts. This
        standard practice allows them to attract customers who prefer the convenience of online shopping.

         <br> <br>During the Customer interview I also learnt that they already have

      Understanding the target audience is crucial for designing effective products and services. One of the most effective
      tools for achieving this understanding is the creation of user personas. These fictional representations of ideal users
      help guide design decisions and ensure that the end product meets the needs and expectations of its users.

          <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">"SHMUCK-Fritz" Jerwelry Workshop&Gallery.</span>
 But then, when she was thinking about the gift for her sisters' bisthday, unfortunetly she didn't found this Berlin Gallery online.
  <br><br><br><img class="img1" src="/schmuck/roxan.png" />

<br><br><br>
    Meet
        <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">Maria:</span>
They are 54 years old, lives in M√ºnchen and works in their jewelry Studio.
          Maria has enough wedding bands' orders, but she is creative person and would like to sell their conceptual jewelry as
          well. But has not skills and time to organize this process. </span><br><br>
          <img class="img1" src="/schmuck/Maria.png" />
 <br><br><br>

      The gallery specializes in creating custom orders, including wedding bands, allowing customers to bring their unique
      visions to life. Additionally, it conducts masterclasses in collaboration with a college, providing educational
      opportunities for those interested in jewelry-making. Although the gallery has previously hosted events and exhibitions,
      the experience has not been as successful as desired, particularly when considering the limited resources and individual
      interests involved.
      <br><br>
      Given this context, I believe it is crucial to concentrate on the gallery‚Äôs stronger points and leverage its unique
      offerings. By focusing on showcasing an amazing collection of art pieces online, we can create a more robust presence
      and attract a wider audience. The gallery itself serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), providing a foundation for
      growth while emphasizing quality and artistry.

            to provide the most complete information, but at the same time ‚Äî always staying open to discussion. With live

          Establishing a cohesive brand identity is essential for any business, as it helps convey a clear message and connect
          with customers. By integrating existing materials and focusing on design elements that reflect the brand's essence, we
          can create a unified visual experience.
<br><br>
          I integrated all the existing materials from my customer into a comprehensive brand system. This foundation allowed me
          to ensure consistency across all touchpoints before moving forward with a dedicated design system.
       
          I chose <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">Brand color system</span> inspired by the facade of the building, ensuring that the palette resonates with the physical space
          and reinforces the brand's identity. Additionally, I utilized the existing logotype, featuring a skeleton of a flamingo,
          as a focal point for the design. To further align the brand's visual identity, I selected a font that closely resembles
          the typography found on the building, creating a strong connection between the brand and its physical location.
  <br><br>
            By bringing together existing materials and thoughtfully selecting design elements, I have crafted a cohesive brand and
            design system that reflects the unique character of my customer‚Äôs business. This approach not only strengthens brand
            recognition but also fosters a deeper connection with the audience, ultimately enhancing their overall experience.

  During a lot of iterations, I build a web site
          <span class="bo" style="word-wrap: break-word">Information Architecture,</span>
          categorizing services and items in a gallery, providing structured information for each one separate piece
          (title, description, year of produce, artist name and name of collection), testing it on the early stage and each one time bringing the correctives. On the image belove you can see the final resut.
